I developed a smart CCTV to detect elderly falls at home using Huskylense, ESP8266 , movement sensor and Arduino UNO. sending Line alerts to caregivers. The system classifies fall severity based on post-fall movementâ€”immediate movement indicates a minor fall, while no movement indicates a severe fall.
